### Hi! I'm Markus Bassermann

Historian | Developer | Dabbler in lots of things

I studied history and sociology in Hamburg and Oslo. Additionally, I've always been passionate about development and am fascinated by the many ways digital methods and the humanities can be and are currently being integrated. I am particularly interested in the intersection of digital games and history, especially in remembrance culture and the museum context.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently deciding on where to go next after having [written my Master-Thesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S5UpGx6470).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis with Python and Game Development in Unity.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the [Digital Humanities Link Repository](https://github.com/Wolfenswan/Digital-Humanities-Link-Repository).
- ðŸ’¬ Get in touch via email!
