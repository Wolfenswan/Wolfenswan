### Hi! I'm Markus

Historian | Developer | Dabbler in many things

I've studied history and sociology in Hamburg and Oslo. Additionally, I've always been passionate about development and am fascinated by the many ways digital methods and the humanities can be and are currently being integrated. 

I am particularly interested in the intersection of digital games and history, especially in remembrance culture and the museum context. For an example, check out [C_rta M_ri_a](https://wolfenswan.itch.io/hanse-game-jam-2021-carta-marina) - a prototype-game developed during the European Hansemuseums first GameJam in April 2021.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently deciding on where to go next after having [written my Master-Thesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S5UpGx6470).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis with Python and Game Development in Unity.
- âœ¨ I sometimes publish small games on [Itch.io](https://wolfenswan.itch.io/).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the [Digital Humanities Link Repository](https://github.com/Wolfenswan/Digital-Humanities-Link-Repository) and interesting game projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Get in touch via [email](&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x6b;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x74;&#x61;&#x6b;&#x74;&#x40;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x62;&#x61;&#x73;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x64;&#x65;)!
